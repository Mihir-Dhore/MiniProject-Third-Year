				<h2>history</h2>
				<p>
					The Chhatrapati Shahu museum in Kolhapur was constructed during the
					period 1877 - 1884. It was designed by British architect 'Charles
					Mant' and was built according to an architectural style that had a
					fusion of Jain and Hindu influences from Gujarat and Rajasthan, along
					with a touch of the local Rajwada style.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					The structure is made from black, polished stone and is certainly an
					architectural masterpiece. The ground floor of the New Palace
					accommodates the Shahaji Chhatrapati Musuem
