                Lal Mahal is one of the famous tourist places in Pune which has another name as Red Palace. It is a beautiful monument established in 1630 AD by Shivaji Maharaj’s father Shahaji Bhosale for his wife and son. Shivaji Maharaj lived here for a long time
                until the time he captured his first fort. The original one had undergone several destructions and the current one is a reconstructed structure, located at the heart of the city. Shivaji’s wedding with Maharani Saibai took place in this
                palace. The original monument was constructed with the aim of rejuvenating the city of Pune when Dadoji Kondev entered the city with Shivaji Maharaj. The history recorded at various places proves the fact that Lal Mahal was used for organising
                feasts for the Brahmins during the thread ceremony of Sadoba, the son of Chimajiappa. <br><br> The original location where the monument was first established is still unknown, perhaps it was known to be located very close
                to the location of Shaniwarwada. The newly constructed Lal Mahal does not have many features the old one possessed and it is not built in the same fashion as well. Pune Municipal Corporation was the one who rebuilt the current Lal Mahal
                and the construction was begun in 1984 and ended in 1988. <br><br> The Lal Mahal became an important part of the history after an encounter between Shivaji and Shaista Khan when the former cut off the latter’s fingers and he tried to escape
                from the window of the Lal Mahal. The current palace displays a collection of large sized oil paintings based on the important events happened in the life of Shivaji. There is the Jijamata Garden now recognised as a recreational park for
                kids. <br><br><b>Entry timings:</b> It is open on all days from <b> 09:00 am to 01:00 pm</b> and then from <b>04:00 pm to 08:00 pm. <br><br> </b> <b>Entry fee:</b> The entry fee to enter the palace is INR 3 per person. <b> <br><br> Location:</b>Lal
                Mahal, Ganesh Rd, Durvankur Society, Kasba Peth, Pune, Maharashtra 411002.
            </p>
            <br /> <br>
            <h2>History Of Lal Mahal</h2> <br>
            <p>Shivaji’s father, Shahaji Maharaj, was the one who laid the foundation of this Lal Mahal. The main reason to construct this colossal structure was the quick revival of the miserable condition of Pune. <br><br> During those days, he served
                in the position of Bijapur Sultanate.<br><br> After conquering a few territories, he was enthroned to rule over some Pune territories. This was the time when he felt necessary to construct a palace for his accommodation.<br><br> Eventually,
                in the year 1630 AD, Lal Mahal stood high with pride. From then, until he acquired Torna Fort in 1645, this was his residential palace. <br><br> This fort has also witnessed the upbringing of Maharashtra’s brave son – Shivaji Maharaj.<br><br>                Yet another story is associated with this fort. It was in April of 1663 when Shivaji Maharaj, along with his battalion of 400+ soldiers, seized the palace and killed Shaista Khan's son. In the same battle, Shivaji Maharaj chopped off Shaista
                Khan’s fingers with his sword. <br><br> The present-day structure of the Lal Mahal was built right on the part of the land where a portion of the original one was destroyed. If you closely compare both the present day and the original
                Lal Mahal, there’s quite a difference.<br><br> This current monument is actually a re-construction work accomplished by the Pune Municipal Corporation in 1998.
