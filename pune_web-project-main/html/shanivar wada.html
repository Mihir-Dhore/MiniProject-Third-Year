                The foundation of the palace fort was laid by Peshwa Baji Rao I in 1730 and the residence complex was completed in 1732 at a cost of Rs. 16,110. The building was constructed by a contractor from Rajasthan known as the ‘Kumawat Kshatriya’. Several additions
                such as the fortification walls, gates, and bastions, court walls, other buildings, fountains, reservoirs were made to the complex later by the Peshwa successors.
                <br> <br> The seven storied building was supposed to be built entirely of stone, but after completion of the base floor, the natives of Satara objected to the Siva (king) stating that a stone monument can only be built by the Siva (king)
                and not the Peshwas. Subsequent to this, an official letter was sent to the Peshwas clearly mentioning that the structure had to be built of brick and not stone. The edifice was completed as per the declaration, and ninety years later
                when the fort was attacked by the British Artillery, all the six stories made of brick collapsed barring the stone base which remained undamaged. In 1828, an unexplained fire heavily destroyed the fort – a few surviving structures is what
                it remains today as the tourist site.

                In 1659, after the death of the Bijapur general Afzal Khan, in the ensuing confusion Shivaji took Panhala from Bijapur. In May 1660, to win back the fort from Shivaji, Adil Shah II (1656–1672) of Bijapur sent his army under the command of Siddi Johar
                to lay siege to Panhala. Shivaji fought back and they could not take the fort. The siege continued for 5 months, at the end of which all provisions in the fort were exhausted and Shivaji was on the verge of being captured.
