                Built in 1982 by Sultan Muhammed Shah Aga Khan III, the Aga Khan Palace is a magnificent piece of history situated in 19 acres of land in the Yerwada area in Pune. <br> <br> Referred to as one of the most important landmarks of Indian
                history, along with the Indian freedom struggle, the palace has its roots deeply etched into bygone eras. <br> <br> The palace was built to help the poor in the areas surrounding Pune, which was drastically hit by famine in the early 1980s.
                <br> <br> One of the most stunning pieces of architecture in all of Pune, the Aga Khan Palace is also a famous tourist attraction, which was designed by a world-famous architect called Charles Correa.<br> <br> Additionally, the palace
                houses the samadhis (memorials) of Mahatma Gandhi’s wife, Kasturba Gandhi. Sources suggest that both Kasturba Gandhi and Mahatma Gandhi’s secretary Mahadev Desai breathed their last in the palace premises. And it is because of this that
                their memorials have been safeguarded in the palace grounds.<br> <br> The Aga Khan Palace is located in a huge ground, and has five, luxurious and spacious halls, along with several lawns. The structure resonates of Italian architecture,
                elegant yet intricate and magnificent.<br> <br> Of all the rooms and features of the palace, its arches are the most beautiful, almost mesmerising to the eyes. Aga Khan Palace has two huge floors, in addition to a corridor which spreads
                across the entire structure. <br> <br> The palace is known for organising several exhibitions and programmes throughout the year. Most of these reflect Gandhi’s lifestyle, thereby offering visitors a deep insight into the Mahatma’s life.
                <br> <br> Moreover, it is because of this and Gandhi’s links to it that the palace is now also known as the Gandhi National Memorial Society. One of the most prominent attractions of the palace is the room where Gandhi stayed during his
                imprisonment, along with his personal belongings and pictures of the other freedom fighters. <br> <br>
