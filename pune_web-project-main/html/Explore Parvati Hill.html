                Amongst the most famous ‘tekdis’ and hillocks in the town of Pune, Maharashtra, Parvati Hill offers visitors gorgeous and stunning views of the surrounding valley. With a history dating back to almost 250 years, Parvati Hill is famous for its temples
                and museums, in addition to being one of the oldest structures in Pune. <br><br> Built in the early mid-17th century, the Parvati Hill Temple Complex can be found on Parvati Hill. The temple is located at the top of the
                hill and enshrines the idols of Lord Ganesha, Goddess Parvati, Lord Vishnu, Lord Karthikeya as well as Devateshwar. It is also said to have served as the sole place of worship of the Peshwa rulers in the bygone eras.<br><br> Situated at
                an elevation of almost 640 metres above sea level, it is also one of the most beautiful locations in the whole city of Pune and offers a great view of the entire city. One can reach the top of the hill simply by climbing 103 steps which
                are marked by specialised stone architectural works of the Maratha style.<br><br> Moreover, the hillock also has the Parvati Museum, which boasts of age-old manuscripts, rare weaponry and one-of-a-kind coins. Located near the museum are
                the Sati Monument and Vetal Chabutra. Additionally, the museum complex also houses the Samadhi Sthan of Shrimant Nanasaheb Peshwa.<br><br> The Parvati Hill Temple Complex is one of the oldest heritage structures in the city, still serving
                as a gentle yet magnificent reminder of the rule of the Peshwas in the region. Many old legends suggest that Balaji Bajirao, the Peshwa ruler, used to watch the Battle of Kirkee and the subsequent defeat of the British from this hill.
