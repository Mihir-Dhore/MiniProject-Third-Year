				<h2>history</h2>
				<p>
					Panahala fort was built between 1178 and 1209 CE, one of 15 forts
					(others including Bavda, Bhudargad, Satara, and Vishalgad) built by
					the Shilahara ruler Bhoja II. It is said that aphorism Kahaan Raja
					Bhoj, kahan Gangu Teli is associated with this fort. A copper plate
					found in Satara shows that Raja Bhoja held court at Panhala from
					1191–1192 CE. About 1209–10, Bhoja Raja was defeated by Singhana
					(1209–1247), the most powerful of the Devgiri Yadavas, and the fort
					subsequently passed into the hands of the Yadavas. Apparently it was
					not well looked after and it passed through several local chiefs. In
					1376 inscriptions record the settlement of Nabhapur to the south-east
					of the fort.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					In 1659, after the death of the Bijapur general Afzal Khan, in the
					ensuing confusion Shivaji took Panhala from Bijapur. In May 1660, to
					win back the fort from Shivaji, Adil Shah II (1656–1672) of Bijapur
					sent his army under the command of Siddi Johar to lay siege to
					Panhala. Shivaji fought back and they could not take the fort. The
					siege continued for 5 months, at the end of which all provisions in
					the fort were exhausted and Shivaji was on the verge of being
					captured.

				<h2>Major Features</h2>
				<br />
				<h3>Fortifications and bastions</h3>
				<p>
					More than 7 km of fortifications (Tatabandi) define the approximately
					triangular zone of Panhala fort. The walls are protected for long
					sections by steep escarpments, reinforced by a parapet with slit
					holes. The remaining sections have 5–9 m (16–30 ft) high ramparts
					without a parapet, strengthened by round bastions the most notable of
					which is Rajdindi.
				</p>

				<br />
				<h3>Andhar Bavadi</h3>
				<p>
					Whenever an army besieged a fort, their first action was to poison the
					main water source of the fort. To counter this, Adil Shah commissioned
					the building of the Andhar Bavadi (Hidden Well). This is a
					three-storey structure with winding staircases that conceal the well
					which was the main water source for Panhala fort
				</p>

				<br />
				<h3>Kalavanticha Mahal</h3>
				<p>
					Kalvanticha Mahal (The courtesan's palace) The name of this building,
					which is also called Nayakini Sajja, literally means "Courtesans'
					Terrace room". It stands on the east side of the fort close to the
					rampart. By 1886, it had become a complete wreck with only traces of
					ornamental work on the ceiling. This was used during the occupation of
					the fort by the Bahmani Sultanate as a Rang Mahal(residences for the
					ladies of the court)
				</p>

				<br />
				<h3>Ambarkhana</h3>
				<p>
					The Amberkhana, situated in the center of the fort, were three
					granaries built in the Bijapuri style of architecture. They enabled
					Shivaji to withstand a 5-month siege by Siddhi Johar. It consists of
					three buildings called the Ganga, Yamuna and Saraswati Kothis.
