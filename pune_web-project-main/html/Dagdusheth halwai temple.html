                of Dagdusheth and a close friend of him. He had the idea of celebrating Ganesh festival at the temple and then onwards, it became an epoch-making event. The beautiful temple has Jay and Vijay, the two sentinels made of marble attracts
                the millions of hearts coming to visit the temple.<br><br> The temple was constructed very simply so that the idol of Ganesha can be seen from outside. The idol is huge with 7.5 feet height and 4 feet width. It was made more beautiful
                by adding nearly 8 kilogrammes of gold. Devotees of the temple offered money and gold regularly and heaps of coconuts are also a special offer done by the people. <br><br> <b> Entry timings:</b> The temple is open on all days from <b>06:00 am to 11:00 pm.</b>                <br><br> <b>Entry Fee:</b> There is no entry fee to be paid to enter the temple.

                In 1659, after the death of the Bijapur general Afzal Khan, in the ensuing confusion Shivaji took Panhala from Bijapur. In May 1660, to win back the fort from Shivaji, Adil Shah II (1656–1672) of Bijapur sent his army under the command of Siddi Johar
                to lay siege to Panhala. Shivaji fought back and they could not take the fort. The siege continued for 5 months, at the end of which all provisions in the fort were exhausted and Shivaji was on the verge of being captured.
